## CSS
We're using STYLUS and BEM style for developing.
https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/
Keep in mind and aware while writing in BEM CSS style

1. Never overriding modifiers in an unrelated block.
2. Avoiding making unnecessary parent elements when the child can exist quite happily by itself.



#FAQ
- How long do you coding.
  - Following my mood but day by day... Maybe 1 or two hours perhaps.
